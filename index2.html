                    Hi!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm Michał, former student of mechatronics, former student of astronomy, currently on my way to become a
                    Java developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is my personal website created in a need of learning some front-end skills.
                    Here you can find more info about me, my hobbies, my adventures with astronomy and photography, as well as
                    track my progress learning programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enjoy!
                </p>
